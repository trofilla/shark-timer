# SharkTimer

This is a small app that implements a timer/stopwatch widget as an Angular component, similar to what you'll see in the results of a Google search for either "[stopwatch](https://www.google.com/search?q=stopwatch)" or "[timer](https://www.google.com/search?q=timer)"

Grab the code and refactor it so that it meets your standard for production ready code.

You do not need to keep the existing code or project structure.

The only requirement is that it maintains basic the functionality of a timer/stopwatch, and that it meets your standards!

## Getting started

Fork + clone this repo and run `npm install` in the root directory of the repo.

## Development server

Run `npm start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` or `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` or `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` or `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
